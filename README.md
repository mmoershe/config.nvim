# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My personal Neovim config.  
It's based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), although I have made some customizations that deviate from the original [Starter-Repository](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter).

# Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mmoershe/config.nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

# Customizations / Deviations

- added lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua with many colorschemes (With **Dracula** as the default)  
- changed some indentation options  
- deactivated the mouse 
- turned on wrapping by default 
- added "*leader* + sf" in normal mode to search for files from the root directory
